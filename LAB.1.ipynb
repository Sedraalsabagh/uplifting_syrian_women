    " Easy-to-maintain: Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\n",
    "A broad standard library: Python's bulk of the library is very portable and\n",
    "cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.\n",
    " Interactive Mode: Python has support for an interactive mode which allows\n",
    "interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.\n",
    " Portable: Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the\n",
    "same interface on all platforms.\n",
    " Extendable: You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These\n",
    "modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more\n",
    "efficient.\n",
    " Databases: Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\n",
    " GUI Programming: Python supports GUI applications that can be created and\n",
    "ported to many system calls, libraries, and windows systems, such as Windows\n",
    "MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\n",
    " Scalable: Python provides a better structure and support for large programs\n",
